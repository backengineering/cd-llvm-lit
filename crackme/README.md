# Crackme

This crackme requires that you run it on a processor that can execute BMI1/BMI2 instructions. If your processor cannot execute these instructions then the program will not work on your system!

To solve this crackme you need to find the input flag to make the binary print "Success". If the key does not work on our binary/computer then it does not count.

# Usage

```
crackme.obfuscated.exe [input flag here]
