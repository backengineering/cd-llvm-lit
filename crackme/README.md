# Crackme

To solve this crackme you need to find the input flag to make the binary print "Success". If the key does not work on our version of the binary then it does not count. You are allowed to patch the program on your end of things for analysis purposes, however the goal is to uncover the input key.

# Usage

```
crackme.obfuscated.exe [input flag here]
```
